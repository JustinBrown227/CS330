# How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by first looking at the project as a whole. "What is the end goal of this project?" From there, I then dissect the project into smaller chunks. What do I need to do, what will this program need, etc. I view it as looking at a blueprint and then making sure I have every tool I will need, as well as tools I might not need but may prove useful later before I get started.

# What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Thinking outside of the box to solve problems. There were many roadblocks throughout this course and I felt stuck, especially after the halfway point. There were a lot of times I was truly stumped and thinking outside of the box, tinkering and trying ideas to fix these problems lead to solutionms that solved my problem.

# What design process did you follow for your project work?
I started small and worked my way up. I experimented a lot as well. When I wanted to create an object using multiple shapes, I had to make sure one piece was complete before moving onto the next. There were often times I had to backtrack and I lost hours of progress because something did not look right or a simple oversight on my part, but I never tried to do too much at once.

# How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Mastering the basics goes a long way in almost any context. But for programming, I would much prefer to fully understand one hundred simple skills and topics rather than know only one complex skill. In this context, I think my method of trying to understand and practice simple concepts before attempting larger projects will help me develop my skills as a programmer, even if tackling bigger projects may seem tempting and yield more noticable progress.

# How do I approach developing programs?
I've always described programming to non-programmers as following a recipe, but when developing programs it's more like a machine with various gears and parts. Knowing where to look when problems arise saves a lot of time when fixing inevitable bugs and issues.

# What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
When working on a project of this scale, the usage of functions was crucial. While I've always understood their purpose, when having to debug, run experiments or even simple tweaking, making sure I properly format functions is essential for developing functional programs.

# How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
The studying and understanding of functions. As a continuation of my previous point, there were so many times something had gone wrong and I was able to quickly fix it thanks to being able to navigate to the function that was causing the issue. For example, if there was an issue relating to the lighting, then I knew where to look and wouldn't have to spend time looking through unrelated functions.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I initially had zero knowledge or experience on 3D modeling or computational graphics when I started this course. I am no means an expert and I have a lot of learning to do, but this course helped me branch out in a different direction from what I was used to and helped me flesh out my skills as a programmer. Overall, this field of computer science helped branch out my skills and pick up something I had no experience in. Not only will this add a new skill for me, but has also given me the experience of having to navigate something I was not familiar with, something that will likely happen in my professional life in the future.
